# FPVS Toolbox

The FPVS Toolbox is a GUI based application for preprocessing, cleaning, and analyzing EEG data collected from Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation (FPVS) paradigm experiments on BioSemi systems. The purpose of this project is to standardize a processing method for FPVS data and to reduce the amount of time that researchers spend analyzing data. 

## Features

- Batch processing of BioSemi `.BDF` data files
- Automated preprocessing pipeline: referencing, filtering, resampling, kurtosis-based channel rejection and interpolation
- Extraction of epochs and post-processing metrics (FFT, SNR, BCA, Z-score)
- Statistical analysis window with repeated measures ANOVA and per-harmonic significance testing
- Image Resizer tool for quickly resizing images for PsychoPy experiments
- Averaging utility for combining epochs across files prior to postâ€‘processing (useful if one needs to combine two similar FPVS experiments prior to calculating BCA)

## Features currently under development:

- Publication quality 2D heatmaps
- Publication quality BCA frequency plots
- Linear mixed-effects model analysis


## Installation

Prebuilt installers are provided on the GitHub Releases page. Each release contains a file named `FPVS_Toolbox_<version>-Setup.exe` created with Inno Setup.

1. Download the installer from the Releases page.
2. Double-click the `.exe` file. Because the installer is unsigned, Windows SmartScreen may warn that the app is unrecognized.
3. Choose **More info** and then **Run anyway** to continue.
4. Follow the prompts to select an install location. The installer places `FPVS_Toolbox.exe` and required libraries in the target folder.

Always verify that you obtained the installer directly from this repository's Releases page before bypassing SmartScreen.

### Running from Source

The application can also be launched from source on Windows. Clone the repository and ensure you have Python 3.9+ with the following packages installed:

- `mne`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scipy`
- `customtkinter`
- `statsmodels` (for statistical analyses)

After installing the dependencies, start the GUI with:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Configuration and Settings

User preferences are stored in `settings.ini` (generated automatically in a configuration folder such as `%APPDATA%\FPVS_Toolbox`). You can adjust appearance mode, default paths, event labels/IDs, and analysis parameters from the Settings window in the application.

Several GUI dimensions are defined in `config.py` if you need to tweak control sizes:

- `BUTTON_WIDTH`
- `ADV_ENTRY_WIDTH`
- `ADV_LABEL_ID_ENTRY_WIDTH`
- `ADV_ID_ENTRY_WIDTH`
