# FPVS Toolbox

The FPVS Toolbox is a GUI based application for preprocessing, cleaning, and analyzing EEG data collected from Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation (FPVS) paradigm experiments on BioSemi systems. The purpose of this project is to standardize a processing method for FPVS data and to reduce the amount of time that researchers spend analyzing data. 

## Features

- Batch processing of BioSemi `.BDF` data files
- Automated preprocessing pipeline: referencing, filtering, resampling, kurtosis-based channel rejection and interpolation
- Extraction of epochs and post-processing metrics (FFT, SNR, BCA, Z-score)
- Built in Statistical analysis tool with repeated-measures ANOVA, linear mixed-effects models, and post-hoc pairwise tests to check for significant FPVS oddball responses in the Frontal, Central, Parietal, and Occipital lobes
- Image Resizer tool for quickly resizing images for PsychoPy experiments
- Averaging utility for combining epochs across files prior to postâ€‘processing (useful if one needs to combine two similar FPVS experiments prior to calculating BCA)
- Publication quality BCA frequency plots

## Features currently under development:

- Publication quality 2D heatmaps


## Installation

Prebuilt installers are provided on the GitHub Releases page. Each release contains a file named `FPVS_Toolbox_<version>-Setup.exe` created with Inno Setup.

1. Download the installer from the Releases page.
2. Double-click the `.exe` file. Because the installer is unsigned, Windows SmartScreen may warn that the app is unrecognized.
3. Choose **More info** and then **Run anyway** to continue.
4. Follow the prompts to select an install location. The installer places `FPVS_Toolbox.exe` and required libraries in the target folder.

Always verify that you obtained the installer directly from this repository's Releases page before bypassing SmartScreen.

### Running from Source

The application can also be launched from source on Windows. Clone the repository and ensure you have Python 3.9+ with the following packages installed:

- `mne`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scipy`
- `customtkinter`
- `statsmodels` (for statistical analyses)
- `matplotlib`

After installing the dependencies, start the GUI with:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

To generate a BCA frequency plot from an Excel results file:

```bash
python -m Tools.bca_plotter results.xlsx -o bca_plot.png
```

The BCA Plotter is also available from the **Tools** menu inside the GUI.
