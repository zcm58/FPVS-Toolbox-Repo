Instructions for Codex: 

Please review the AGENTS.md file in each directory for specific instructions
before making major edits. 

In general, the app GUI should not be altered significantly unless a new button or
toolbar option is needed when adding new features.

fpvs_app.py is the main file for the application. When suggesting changes or refactor
options to this file, please do not change or edit code, just suggest ways to copy
and paste code from fpvs_app.py into new standalone .py files that you place in 
the Main_App directory. You can add imports into the fpvs_app.py file where needed.

Do not edit the spacing or the size of the buttons on the top of the app (Select Input Folder, Select Output Folder, 
Star Processing) unless specifically instructed to do so. Do not adjust the frame or the spacing unless instructed
to do so. 

When adding new features, please try to keep the code modular and under 500 lines per file.
