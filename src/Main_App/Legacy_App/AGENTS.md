This directory contains the core functionality of the FPVS Toolbox. 
The GUI code should be kept separate from the functionality of the app.

Instructions for Codex: 

Processing should always occur on a separate thread from the GUI
so that it does not become unresponsive. 

**The eeg_preprocessing.py file should not be edited for any reason.**

**post_process.py should not be edited for any reason.**

The main_app.py GUI should not be altered in any way unless given specific 
instructions to do so.
