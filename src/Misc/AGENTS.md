This Misc directory will just house scripts that may not be needed for the main 
app to function, but might be relevant from a software development perspective. 

The Compiler Script.py file is just a place to house a script to run in the terminal
to compile the app into an .exe. There is no need to update or change this file as 
it is just used to copy/paste code into the terminal for compiling.
