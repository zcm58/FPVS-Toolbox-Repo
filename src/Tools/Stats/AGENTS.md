The stats module is meant to help the user analyze data from FPVS EEG based experiments.
The goal of the stats module is to aid in the statistical analysis of one particular subset of EEG data. 

Future features should include top down 2d heatmaps of the brain based on region, which would require
some form of red/blue heatmap based on the summed BCA values of each region of interest as defined in the FPVS_app.py.
