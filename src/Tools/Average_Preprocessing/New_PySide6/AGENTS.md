In the New_PySide6 directory of the Average_Preprocessing tool, we are working on a new GUI using PySide6. 
This directory is intended to replace the legacy customtkinter GUI with a more modern look and feel. We are ONLY going
to add a PySide6 GUI replica of the legacy customtkinter GUI, and we will not be adding any new features or 
functionality at this time. You are to import the files in Tools/Average_Preprocessing/Legacy and wire those functions
up to the New PySide6 GUI. do NOT alter, edit, add, or delete any files in the Legacy directory. You can only import
them to the New PySide6 GUI. If you need to add new files, please do so in the New_PySide6 directory and replicate the
files from the Legacy directory.
