The Plot_Generator directory contains the standalone PySide6 tool that builds SNR
or BCA line plots from Excel files created by the FPVS Toolbox. GUI adjustments
and minor bug fixes are allowed. Keep processing code modular and under 500 lines
per file. ROI definitions should be loaded from the existing settings using the
utilities in `Tools.Stats`. Plots should be averaged across participants within
each condition and saved to a user selected output folder.
