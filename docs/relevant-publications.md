# Relevant Publications

This page lists key articles and books that informed the design of the FPVS Toolbox, including choices in paradigm design, preprocessing, and statistical analysis. It is not exhaustive, but it should give users a solid starting point to understand the methods behind the software.

  **Exploring facial expression processing with fast periodic visual stimulation and diverse stimuli.** *Brain and Cognition.* 2025; doi:10.1016/j.bandc.2025.106338.

- Vandenheever et. al, 2025.  
  **Preliminary evidence for anxiety linked neural sensitivity to emotional faces using fast periodic visual stimulation.** *International Journal of Psychophysiology.* doi: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2025.113212.


These papers provide the main conceptual and analytical background for FPVS paradigms, oddball designs, and harmonic-based frequency-tagging analyses used in the Toolbox.

## EEG / ERP Methods and Preprocessing



These references give general foundations for EEG/ERP recording, artifact handling, filtering, referencing, and statistical analysis that inform the preprocessing pipeline.

---

## Statistical Methods and Linear Mixed Models



These works underpin the use of Benjamini–Hochberg FDR correction and linear mixed-effects models for the statistical outputs generated by the FPVS Toolbox.
