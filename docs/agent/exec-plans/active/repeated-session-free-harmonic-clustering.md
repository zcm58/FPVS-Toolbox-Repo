# Repeated-Session Free Harmonic Clustering

## Status

Complete on branch `codex/repeated-session-fhc`.

Started 2026-08-18. This plan covers a versioned repeated-session batch beside
the frozen legacy single-contrast workflow.

## Goal

Extend Free Harmonic Clustering (FHC) to canonical repeated-session projects
without collapsing visits or treating recordings as independent. For two
ordered groups, two ordered sessions, and every selected condition, one batch
must estimate four participant-level contrast families:

1. Group A minus Group B after averaging the two sessions within each complete
   participant;
2. Visit 2 minus Visit 1 within Group A;
3. Visit 2 minus Visit 1 within Group B; and
4. Group A minus Group B in participant-level Visit 2 minus Visit 1 change.

The Birth Control project is the first real-data acceptance project. Its labels
must remain `Luteal Phase (Visit 1)` and `Follicular Phase (Visit 2)`, with the
fixed-order phase/visit/time/retest confounding stated in every human-readable
result.

## Locked Scientific Decisions

- Preserve `hermann_free_harmonic_clustering_cleanroom_v2` and its powered null
  receipt exactly for legacy `independent_groups` and `paired_conditions` runs.
- Give the repeated-session batch a separate versioned method/contract. The
  legacy calibration receipt is not evidence for the new batch workflow.
- Resolve participant, group, recording, session, visit, condition, and source
  identity only through the managed project and neutral FullFFT provenance.
- Require exactly two selected stable groups and exactly two selected sessions
  with distinct visit indices. Keep incomplete visits as audited coverage; use
  complete pairs for all four primary families.
- Honor project QC/exclusions and allow additive analysis-specific recording
  exclusions with required reasons. Never mutate `project.json` or QC state.
- Build one shared harmonic domain across every included
  group x session x condition cell, then freeze it for the whole batch.
- For the session-averaged group family, average the two candidate-SNR tensors
  within participant and L2-normalize that mean once.
- For paired-session families, L2-normalize each session tensor separately and
  sign-flip the participant Visit 2 minus Visit 1 tensors.
- For the group-by-session-change family, compare those participant Visit 2
  minus Visit 1 tensors by whole-participant group-label permutation; do not
  renormalize the difference tensor.
- Keep the existing spatial/free-harmonic graph, node-entry threshold, signed
  cluster mass, separate directional max-cluster nulls, and default 10,000
  assignments.
- A run-level two-sided global p-value is the strongest cluster's existing
  doubled two-sided max-cluster p (1 when no cluster forms). Apply Holm across
  the selected conditions within each of the four named scientific families,
  and also export conservative Holm adjustment across every batch run.
  Cross-condition corrections are run-level; cluster-specific raw p-values
  must not be relabelled as cross-condition adjusted.
- FHC concerns the normalized electrode x harmonic response distribution, not
  total Raw BCA magnitude. Cluster-level significance never establishes an
  individual node as pointwise significant.

## Non-Goals

- Do not change standard harmonic selection, Summed BCA, preprocessing, QC,
  project metadata, source workbooks, or legacy FHC calibration code.
- Do not add a general repeated-measures model builder or pretend that fixed
  phase order can be separated from visit/order/time/retest.
- Do not use or inspect `src/Standalone_Scripts/**`.
- Do not run Qt or offscreen GUI tests locally.

## Delivery Phases

### Phase 1 — Recording-Aware Preparation

- Add immutable repeated-batch requests, audit identities, prepared-run, and
  prepared-batch models.
- Stream each canonical FullFFT workbook once, validate recording/session/group
  ownership and one shared grid, and create all four tensor families.
- Select and freeze one harmonic domain for all included conditions and arms.
- Add synthetic coverage for incomplete visits, unstable identities, explicit
  exclusions, tensor construction, normalization, and legacy compatibility.

### Phase 2 — Batch Inference And Export

- Reuse the existing whole-participant permutation core for each prepared run.
- Add deterministic per-run seeds, progress/cancellation, run-global p-values,
  within-family Holm, and all-batch Holm.
- Publish one additive transactional batch containing a readable summary,
  per-run cluster/node/null details, full cohort/coverage/exclusion audit,
  shared harmonic provenance, CSV/NPZ data, and completion manifest.
- Add a headless CLI path suitable for the Birth Control acceptance run.

### Phase 3 — GUI And Documentation

- Keep the legacy one-contrast GUI unchanged for flat projects.
- For repeated projects, expose the two ordered groups, two ordered sessions,
  all-condition batch, fixed-order warning, method summary, and
  analysis-specific recording exclusions in a 1280x900-safe workflow.
- Run preparation, 16 permutation analyses, and export in one worker pipeline;
  widgets receive signals only.
- Update package/user/method docs, verification registry, and CI-only
  pytest-qt smoke definitions.

### Phase 4 — Verification And Birth Control Acceptance

- Run focused non-Qt FHC tests, audits, compilation, Ruff, diff checks, and the
  appropriate repository gate. Record any sandbox-only failures separately.
- In the managed Birth Control project, run the full four-family x four-
  condition batch with `P18__follicular_phase` excluded for the user-declared
  outlier reason and all existing project QC decisions retained.
- Inspect the workbook/manifest, summarize raw and adjusted cluster results in
  manuscript style, and state sample coverage and the fixed-order limitation.
- Commit the verified branch without staging unrelated `outputs/**` artifacts.

## Verification

- `.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -m pytest tests/free_harmonic_clustering -q`
- `.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe .agents/scripts/verify.py --scope free-harmonic-clustering --tier focused`
- `.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe .agents/skills/pyside6-gui-cleanup/scripts/audit_gui_imports.py`
- `.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe .agents/skills/project-path-audit/scripts/audit_hardcoded_paths.py`
- `.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe .agents/scripts/verify.py --scope repo --tier precommit`
- `git diff --check`

## Baseline

- Branch started clean at `88486583` except for unrelated untracked
  `outputs/**` artifacts, which remain outside this feature.
- Baseline FHC suite: 109 passed; the only failure was the existing Windows
  managed-sandbox denial when `ProcessPoolExecutor` creates its named pipe in
  the null-calibration determinism test.
- GUI import audit passed. Project-path audit reported only eight unrelated,
  pre-existing hard-coded developer paths below untracked `outputs/rcads-*`.

## Progress

- [x] Recording-aware preparation models and canonical input inspection.
- [x] Batch inference, run-global multiplicity, atomic export, and headless CLI.
- [x] Automatic repeated-project GUI mode, batch-local reasoned recording
  exclusions, one worker pipeline, compact result table, and CI-only pytest-qt
  smoke definitions.
- [x] Scoped architecture, agent contract, user guide, reporting checklist,
  tool information, and parent repeated-session plan updated.
- [x] Integrated verification and the 10,000-assignment Birth Control
  acceptance run completed with `P18__follicular_phase` excluded for the
  investigator-declared Raw BCA outlier.
- [x] The result bundle was independently reconciled across manifest, CSV,
  NPZ, and workbook artifacts. No run survived Holm correction within its
  scientific family or across all 16 runs. The sole nominal within-run result
  was the session-averaged Neutral Happy group comparison (two-sided cluster
  p=.0404; within-family Holm p=.1616; all-batch Holm p=.6463).
- [x] Commit the verified branch.

## Acceptance Record

- Run ID: `birth-control-fhc-p18-excluded-20260818`.
- Complete-pair counts: BC n=9 and control n=13 for Neutral Angry, Neutral
  Happy, and Neutral Sad; BC n=8 and control n=13 for Angry Control after the
  existing P19 recording-condition QC exclusion.
- Shared automatic domain: 29 non-base-overlap harmonics through H36
  (1.2--43.2 Hz), fingerprint
  `3aefaf94d0da0c105cfa2c68fe3acf9178f1dec06ca011807b633056dc6e5cbb`.
- All 25 manifest-listed artifact hashes and sizes matched. Every one of the
  16 NPZ files contained 64 sensors, the same 29 harmonics, and both 10,000-row
  signed null arrays. Run-global p values, both Holm layers, stable seeds,
  cohort counts, exclusion reasons, and source identities independently
  reconciled.
- The workbook's nine sheets were imported and rendered with the bundled
  spreadsheet runtime; the formula-error scan returned zero matches.
- Focused non-Qt suite: 125 passed with the single ProcessPool determinism test
  deselected inside the managed sandbox; that exact test passed separately in
  the permitted host context. Ruff, compile, GUI-import, protected-source,
  production-print, and diff checks passed.
- The focused verification driver stops only at the eight unrelated existing
  hard-coded-path findings below untracked `outputs/rcads-*`; no feature file
  added a machine-specific path. Qt smoke remains CI-only by repository rule.
