# Hauk-Informed Source PSD Workflow

Status: implemented
Owner: FPVS Toolbox
Feature branch: `codex/hauk-source-psd`

## Goal

Replace the normal amplitude-workbook projection routes for new L2-MNE and
eLORETA source-map builds with time-domain-first source-frequency workflows.
The two methods share FPVS Toolbox preprocessing, frequency QC, significant-harmonic
selection, source-cohort, exact-bin, z-score, prepared-payload, and rendering
contracts while retaining independent inverse calculations and source arrays.

This is a Toolbox adaptation of the source-analysis sequence described by Hauk and colleagues, not a claim of byte-for-byte reproduction of the public reference scripts.

## Locked Product Decisions

- The supported input is EEG only. MEG input is out of scope.
- The intended anatomy is the MNE `fsaverage` template with the Toolbox BioSemi64 EEG geometry. Individual MRI/coregistration workflows are out of scope.
- The locked sensor preprocessing order and numerical behavior do not change.
- Repetitions are averaged in the signed time domain before source spectral estimation.
- L2-MNE source spectra use MNE minimum-norm estimation with `method="MNE"`,
  `lambda2=1/9`, `loose=0.2`, `depth=None`, and no
  dSPM/sLORETA/eLORETA normalization. The default method identity is
  `l2_mne_hauk_source_psd_cortical_normal_v1`; it calls MNE source PSD with
  `pick_ori="normal"` so the cortical surface-normal component is selected
  before power-to-amplitude conversion. Source Map Options may explicitly use
  historical `l2_mne_hauk_source_psd_v1` to reproduce older maps that pooled
  free orientations through MNE source PSD.
- eLORETA uses a separately prepared MNE volume inverse with
  `method="eLORETA"`, `lambda2=1/9`, a 10 mm fsaverage volume grid,
  `loose=1.0`, and `depth=None`. It is computed from the same signed FIFs,
  not from L2-MNE z-score or power arrays. The current method identity is
  `eloreta_volume_hauk_source_psd_vector_norm_v1`: complex periodic-Hann
  coefficients are computed at only the exact required bins, passed through
  `apply_inverse(..., pick_ori="vector")`, and reduced per source as
  `sqrt(sum(abs(Cxyz)^2))`. Historical
  `eloreta_volume_hauk_source_psd_v1` outputs remain readable but are labeled
  legacy because their pooled free-orientation result is basis-dependent.
- The EEG-only template inverse uses MNE's ad-hoc diagonal EEG covariance because Toolbox projects do not require a separate resting/noise recording. This intentionally differs from the recorded resting covariance used by the reference study and is preserved in output provenance.
- Project-selected significant oddball harmonics remain the source harmonic plan. Base-frequency overlaps remain excluded by the existing selection contract.
- Exact FPVS frequency-bin identity is required; nearest-bin substitution is forbidden.
- The Toolbox neighboring-bin rule is intentional: offsets `-10..-2` and `+2..+10`, followed by removal of one minimum and one maximum finite noise value and population-SD z scoring (`ddof=0`). This yields nine candidate bins per side before trimming and is a named Toolbox adaptation where it differs from interpretations of the Hauk reference method.
- Current amplitude-derived L2-MNE and eLORETA manifests remain readable as legacy/exploratory outputs. They are not silently relabeled as time-domain source PSD.
- A normal rebuild generates `l2_mne_hauk_source_psd_cortical_normal_v1` and
  `eloreta_volume_hauk_source_psd_vector_norm_v1`. The GUI can substitute the
  explicit legacy L2 method for the former when reproducing older maps. Neither
  time-domain method falls back to `FullFFT Amplitude (uV)` or the Stats-ready
  workbook.
- The eLORETA route is a Hauk-informed Toolbox extension of the source-spectrum
  sequence, not a claim that Hauk et al. implemented this exact EEG-only
  fsaverage eLORETA volume workflow.
- The cortical-normal L2 orientation choice matches the Hauk source estimator
  more closely than the historical pooled-orientation route. It remains a
  Toolbox adaptation because anatomy, modality, covariance, preprocessing, and
  neighboring-bin details differ from the reference study.
- Source orientation and vector pooling are calculation-side contracts. The
  renderer and display selectors consume prepared values without recomputing or
  reinterpreting them.
- Source settings and generated-output state do not expand `project.json` in this phase.
- Project source inference uses explicit available-case cohorts per
  group-condition cell. A completed participant contributes to every canonical
  condition with a committed derivative; a declared missing condition omits
  only that participant-condition input. Empty group-condition cells are
  omitted, one-participant cells remain descriptive without inferential cluster
  masking, and every map records its participant count and identities. Unknown
  availability or no available canonical condition remains a global
  source-ineligibility. Neither omission scope is added to the general project
  exclusion workbook.

## Architecture Contract

### Processing derivative

While condition `EpochsArray` objects are still resident, the Main App writes one averaged, signed EEG Raw FIF per participant and condition plus JSON provenance. A participant commit manifest is published last, after all expected condition files succeed.

Canonical project-relative layout:

```text
6 - Source Localization/
  Source-Ready Time Domain v1/
    <condition>/
      <group when applicable>/
        <participant>_<condition_id>_avg_raw.fif
        <participant>_<condition_id>_avg_raw.json
    manifests/
      <group when applicable>/
        <participant>.json
```

The derivative is a durable generated project output, not the resettable `.fpvs_cache/preprocessed` cache. It contains EEG only, volts, exact processed sampling frequency and sample count, the existing montage/reference/projector state, and no FFT, magnitude, rectification, spectral window, or source calculation.

The sidecar records schema/method version, participant/group/condition/event identity, source-file signature, processing fingerprint/version, MNE version, sample/bin contract, ordered channels/types/units, reference and bad-channel provenance, repetition/crop metadata, future-compatible resolved rate/modulation fields, and a content checksum.

### Source producer

All inverse and source-spectrum math stays in `src/Tools/LORETA_Visualizer/source_producers/`. Project orchestration first derives the explicit source-eligible participant set and available participant membership for each canonical condition. A read-only project adapter then strictly validates every retained participant-condition derivative and loads one at a time. Each producer uses its own EEG-only fsaverage inverse model, obtains source amplitudes at the same exact required bins, sums aligned target/noise positions across selected harmonics in its own source space, and applies the same Toolbox neighboring-bin z-score rule. L2-MNE cortical values, eLORETA volume values, caches, and cluster arrays remain method-specific.

More specifically, default L2-MNE obtains cortical-normal PSD with
`pick_ori="normal"` and then converts power to amplitude. Current eLORETA does
not pool scalar source PSD: it preserves complex exact-bin periodic-Hann
coefficients through a vector eLORETA inverse and pools the three output
components with `sqrt(sum(abs(Cxyz)^2))`. The shared contracts begin again at
exact-bin source amplitudes and the subsequent harmonic/noise z-score sequence.

Participant z maps then enter the existing group aggregation, clustering, ROI, lateralization, prepared-payload, and manifest stages. A one-participant condition/group remains valid for descriptive aggregation but skips the unavailable one-sample permutation stage and records an explicit insufficient-participants mask status. Renderer and importer payload schemas remain unchanged unless implementation evidence requires a versioned additive field.
Multi-group projects must create separate group-by-condition summaries and cluster inputs; canonical groups must never be silently pooled.

### Failure and migration behavior

- Failure to write a source-ready derivative does not invalidate an otherwise successful Excel export; it produces explicit source-readiness status.
- Explicitly missing participant-condition inputs are omitted only from the
  affected source condition. Participants with unknown condition availability
  or no retained canonical conditions are omitted from every source condition.
  The prepared manifest, participant sidecar, validation report, progress
  status, and structured log distinguish both omission scopes and reasons.
- The shared source-input adapter selects the exact sample count `N` supported
  by a unique modal number of participants before either inverse runs.
  Nonmodal participant-condition derivatives
  are condition-specific source omissions with actual/canonical `N`, duration,
  and frequency resolution in provenance. Tied modal distributions remain hard
  failures; the exporter does not mix FFT resolutions, resample, zero-pad, or
  shorten every valid derivative to an anomalously short record.
- Every retained source input remains strict: missing/corrupt derivatives,
  mixed fingerprints, invalid groups, incompatible channels/bins, or zero
  prepared group-condition maps still stop generation.
- Source generation depends on frequency QC/harmonic selection and valid time-domain derivatives, not on successful Stats-ready workbook creation alone.
- Older projects may later receive an explicit backfill action from a valid preprocessed-Raw cache. In this phase, missing derivatives prompt normal reprocessing; amplitude workbooks are never an implicit fallback.
- Projects that already contain valid signed source-ready FIF/JSON derivatives
  do not need sensor reprocessing for these orientation changes. Rebuild the
  source maps to produce the new method identities and caches from the existing
  derivatives.
- Incremental participant reprocessing removes/replaces only that participant's source-ready outputs. Reprocess-all keeps the existing generated-source cleanup behavior.

## Planned Implementation

1. Document the method boundary and intentional Toolbox adaptations.
2. Add a GUI-neutral, project-root-confined derivative writer with atomic FIF/JSON publication and focused round-trip tests.
3. Integrate derivative publication and separate source-readiness state into participant processing without changing the locked preprocessing sequence or existing Excel formats.
4. Add a manifest validator/loader and a reusable opaque fsaverage inverse-model bundle inside `source_producers`.
5. Add the Hauk-informed source-PSD numerical producer with exact-bin validation and deterministic unit tests.
6. Add project orchestration, bounded cache keys, prepared-output export,
   progress reporting, default cortical-normal method identity
   `l2_mne_hauk_source_psd_cortical_normal_v1`, and explicit historical
   `l2_mne_hauk_source_psd_v1` reproduction under
   `6 - Source Localization/L2-MNE Hauk Source PSD Beta`.
7. Add the independent volume inverse, precomputed-volume payload adapter, and
   corrected method identity `eloreta_volume_hauk_source_psd_vector_norm_v1`
   under `6 - Source Localization/eLORETA Hauk Source PSD Beta`, while reusing
   only the shared signed-FIF/cohort/bin/statistical contracts and retaining the
   prior method ID as historical/legacy.
8. Make normal builds generate and load both source-PSD methods while retaining legacy prepared-output import and explicit labeling.
9. Update focused architecture/user method reporting and run processing, project-I/O, LORETA, GUI non-Qt, protected-boundary, and precommit verification.

## Verification and Acceptance

- Exported FIF values equal the arithmetic mean of signed repetition epochs after reload.
- Phase/polarity, volts, EEG ordering, sample frequency, exact `N`, digitization, and reference state survive round trip.
- Every derivative and manifest path remains under the active project root; interrupted publication is not accepted as complete.
- After explicit group-condition available-case eligibility filtering, the
  producer converts uniquely nonmodal sample-count records into explicit
  condition omissions, while rejecting tied sample-count distributions,
  missing/nonfinite retained inputs, incompatible channel/bin contracts,
  nearest-bin substitutions, mismatched per-condition participant sets, and
  stale/corrupt checksums with actionable errors.
- Frozen-array tests lock harmonic alignment, sum-before-z-score, Toolbox offsets, min/max removal, and population SD.
- Direct-MNE fixtures verify that L2 calls `compute_source_psd` with
  `method="MNE"` and `pick_ori="normal"` by default, while eLORETA calls
  `apply_inverse` with `method="eLORETA"` and `pick_ori="vector"`; both preserve
  the derivative sampling/bin contract and apply their declared amplitude
  conversion or vector pooling.
- Frozen tests verify exact complex periodic-Hann coefficients, the
  `sqrt(sum(abs(Cxyz)^2))` vector norm and rotation invariance, plus identical
  downstream exact-bin/harmonic/z-score arithmetic once method-specific source
  amplitudes have been obtained. They do not imply that real L2-MNE and
  eLORETA arrays are interchangeable.
- Existing source aggregation/cluster/prepared-payload behavior remains covered.
- One-participant project/group fixtures write descriptive L2-MNE and eLORETA
  payloads while marking cluster inference unavailable rather than failing the
  full source export.
- The existing amplitude-derived manifests still import but are presented as legacy/exploratory.
- No retired source-localization path, bundled fsaverage tree, MEG branch, individual-MRI workflow, or `project.json` source state is introduced.
- Local verification remains non-GUI. A visible/manual Source Map rebuild path is documented for final handoff; pytest-qt remains CI-only.

## Progress Log

- 2026-07-15: Published the previous processing-cache-reset changes as commit `6c08c83` on `codex/condition-aware-qc-speedup`.
- 2026-07-15: Created `codex/hauk-source-psd` from the published commit.
- 2026-07-15: Baseline LORETA focused verification passed (175 tests plus source-boundary, GUI-import, and path audits).
- 2026-07-15: Locked EEG-only fsaverage scope, project-selected harmonics, and the intentional Toolbox frequency-bin rule.
- 2026-07-15: Implemented signed participant-condition time-domain derivatives, atomic manifests, processing-ledger invalidation, and strict project-input validation.
- 2026-07-15: Implemented the EEG-only fsaverage MNE source-PSD producer, exact-bin harmonic/noise alignment, participant cache, validation report, prepared payloads, worker orchestration, and normal-rebuild GUI integration.
- 2026-07-15: Verified the native MNE 1.9.0 `ico3` path end to end with 1,284 fsaverage sources; the loose-orientation inverse remains native while the renderer descriptor is reduced to one orientation norm per source.
- 2026-07-15: Hardened cohort handling so stale ledgers, failed participants, partial condition sets, and mixed project groups cannot silently alter source inference.
- 2026-07-15: Completed focused numerical, processing, project-I/O, static GUI-worker, documentation, boundary, and repository audits; the repository precommit gate passed with 859 tests and 2 skips. Local interactive Qt smoke testing remains deferred to the visible/manual path.
- 2026-07-16: Reconciled processing partial-condition behavior with source
  orchestration: source-ineligible participants were then omitted complete-case
  from all conditions with durable warnings, while the retained derivative
  matrix stays strict. Hardened Windows long-path containment so equivalent
  `D:\...` and `\\?\D:\...` spellings do not falsely reject project-local
  source-ready outputs. Focused LORETA, processing, project-I/O, and GUI gates
  passed; repository precommit completed with 863 tests passed and 2 skipped.
- 2026-07-16: Migrated eLORETA to an independent time-domain source-PSD path.
  The normal rebuild now generates both cortical L2-MNE and volume eLORETA from
  the same validated signed FIF cohort and exact FPVS bin plan. eLORETA retains
  its own inverse, cache, participant arrays, aggregation, and volume-adjacency
  cluster mask; legacy FullFFT manifests remain importable but are not fallback
  inputs.
- 2026-07-16: Versioned source-orientation behavior. L2-MNE now defaults to the
  Hauk-closer cortical-normal estimator with a GUI-selectable historical pooled
  mode. eLORETA now preserves complex exact-bin coefficients through a vector
  inverse and uses a rotation-invariant three-component norm. New method IDs and
  cache provenance prevent either result from being confused with historical
  basis-dependent outputs; existing signed derivatives can be rebuilt without
  reprocessing.
- 2026-07-16: Hardened recent source-map edge cases. One-participant groups now
  retain descriptive maps without fabricating a permutation mask; partial
  method success refreshes the open viewer; failed regeneration clears only
  obsolete project-loaded maps; eLORETA and validation-report provenance now
  match the vector and 18-candidate/16-retained noise-bin contracts; and
  harmonic-cache bookkeeping no longer causes participant source-cache misses.
- 2026-07-28: Replaced global complete-case source filtering with
  `available_case_by_group_condition_v1`. Completed participant-condition
  derivatives now contribute wherever available; empty group-condition cells
  are omitted, one-participant cells remain descriptive, and condition-level
  omissions plus per-map participant counts are carried through manifests,
  sidecars, validation reports, logs, and GUI status.
- 2026-07-28: Added a shared unique-modal sample-count contract for both
  source inverses. Nonmodal participant-condition records are now flagged and
  omitted without blocking other conditions; ambiguous ties still fail. The
  ACR diagnostic retains 242 derivatives at `N=30720` and identifies only
  P1/Negative Valence and P4/Negative Valence (`N=4480`) as nonmodal.

## Deferred Work

- Alternative phase-sensitive estimators beyond the current exact-bin complex
  vector eLORETA path.
- MEG, individual MRI, participant-specific forward models, and coregistration.
- GUI configuration for arbitrary presentation rates, oddball rates, and sinusoidal contrast modulation.
- Cooperative cancellation within an individual native MNE source-PSD calculation; current progress is reported between participant-condition units.
- Cross-version parity testing against a frozen Hauk/MNE reference environment when a shareable reference fixture is available.
