# FullFFT NumPy Companion Migration

User-approved on 2026-09-05. Replace dense FullFFT Excel storage with an
uncompressed NumPy companion alongside each condition workbook. Include the
already-calculated FullSNR arrays so plotting avoids wide Excel reads too.
Keep preprocessing, timing, FFT, noise, averaging, harmonic, and ROI math intact.

## Contract

- `Main_App.io.spectral_data` owns versioned non-pickled NPZ storage and one
  shared full/header/selected-column reader with legacy XLSX compatibility.
- Store every value, exact FFT grid, display labels, channel order, units and
  calculation metadata without truncation or further rounding. Preserve
  FullSNR values independently; never recompute them from averaged FullFFT.
- New workbooks retain Excel reports and small spectral-sheet notices, plus
  a `Spectral Data` manifest naming an immutable, content-addressed companion
  in the same directory. Companion references cannot escape that directory.
- Write/validate the companion first, then atomically publish the workbook.
  Record both artifacts in completion receipts and downstream fingerprints.
- Missing, corrupt, mismatched or altered declared companions fail clearly.
  Only workbooks without a companion declaration use legacy Excel data.
- Moving/copying a project or freezing plotting inputs must preserve companions.
  Existing Excel-only projects remain readable; no automatic data rewrite.

## Execution

- [x] Shared companion storage/readers and exact round-trip checks.
- [x] Writer, 512-Hz export, receipts, incremental completeness and project I/O.
- [x] Stats, FullFFT QC/provenance and Free Harmonic Clustering readers/caches.
- [x] SNR plots, scalp-map consumers and immutable plotting snapshots.
- [x] Focused scientific/format parity, missing/tampered data and portability
  checks; architecture/user docs and visible smoke instructions.

## Verification

Use focused processing, project-I/O, plotting, publication-map, Stats and FHC
non-GUI gates. Cover full and selected reads, 120 seconds at 512 Hz, exact
FFT-bin neighborhoods, unchanged FullSNR curves, legacy workbooks, moved
project folders and interrupted publication. Qt execution remains CI-only.
The pre-existing eight path-audit findings under `outputs/` are outside scope.

The active-reader review also found and migrated Individual Detectability.
No application-owned project clone/archive or workbook-only copy workflow
exists; project portability is covered by moved-folder tests, relative
companion references and user instructions to preserve both files.

Synthetic local comparison (64 channels, 120 seconds at 256 Hz, FullFFT and
FullSNR, same input arrays, previous HEAD production writer versus new writer):
XLSX write 12.906 s versus companion/workbook write 0.132 s; both full reads
6.924 s versus 0.225 s; combined size 15.66 versus 10.76 MiB. One run, OS cache
not flushed; this measures storage only, not overall application throughput.
The production 512-Hz export test preserves FFT bytes and FullSNR values exactly.

Visible smoke (pending local user/CI environment): process one condition,
confirm the workbook and NPZ appear together, then run post-processing, SNR
Plots, Scalp Maps and Individual Detectability. Check a legacy project too.
Copy both artifacts to another project location and repeat; temporarily
withhold the companion in a test copy and confirm a clear missing-data error.
Do not run offscreen Qt locally.

Final non-GUI verification: processing focused gate 643 passed, 1 skipped;
Stats focused gate 402 passed; registered project-I/O targets 132 passed;
FHC targets 144 passed; Plot targets plus companion consumers 121 passed;
Scalp/Publication Maps targets 117 passed. Target sets overlap; these are
per-command counts. Relevant Ruff/compile and `git diff --check` passed.
The broad `verify.py --scope repo --tier precommit` gate stopped at the same
eight pre-existing `outputs/` path findings. Project-I/O, Plot, Scalp and FHC
driver path gates share that blocker, so their registered safe test commands
were executed directly. Visible GUI smoke remains a handoff check, not a
claim of local Qt execution.

## Compact condition data extension (2026-09-05)

User approved a separate uncompressed NumPy companion for already-calculated
FFT amplitude, BCA, SNR, Z, and processing-owned eligibility/audit tables.
Default per-condition XLSX files become small manifests/notices; preserve the
automatic long/wide statistical workbooks. Keep legacy XLSX reads and provide
an explicit report-writer option for compact Excel copies. Never recompute
metrics from averaged FullFFT or change timing, noise, harmonic, or ROI math.

- [x] Commit/push prior work before starting (`f356b035`).
- [x] Separate compact companion, shared readers, and atomic publication.
- [x] Stats, Scalp Maps, Ratio, SNR setup, QC, source identities, and cleanup.
- [x] Exact parity, legacy/missing/corrupt/moved data, long/wide export tests,
      measured storage benchmark, docs, and focused verification.
- [x] After storage is complete, investigate P56/P9 missing start markers;
      do not infer or synthesize trigger timing or silently exclude data.
- [x] Add explicit GUI recovery for missing expected conditions, preserving
      FFT-grid calculations and requiring reprocessing after changed exclusions.

Production-writer benchmark against `f356b035`: median of three writes,
486 ms -> 185 ms (62% faster). Median of five reads of three metric sheets
plus eligibility: 28.3 -> 21.6 ms for 12 selected frequencies (24% faster),
33.0 -> 22.9 ms for all 40 frequencies (31% faster). Fresh application caches,
warm filesystem cache, integrity checks retained. Fixture: 64 electrodes,
four 40-frequency metric tables, 2,560 QC rows, eligibility/neighbors, and
unchanged FullFFT/FullSNR arrays. Workbook 235 KB -> 13 KB; total size +1.9%.
Stored tables match exactly. These are storage timings, not whole-app forecasts.

Visible smoke (pending): process a small condition and confirm both NPZ
companions appear beside its small workbook. Open SNR Plots, Scalp Maps,
Stats and Ratio Calculator; complete frequency-domain QC and verify long/wide
Excel outputs. Repeat with legacy Excel inputs. In a test copy, withhold one
companion and confirm a clear error. No local Qt execution.

Final extension checks: processing focused gate 678 passed, 1 skipped;
combined registered non-Qt project-I/O, Stats, Plot, Scalp and Ratio targets
811 passed. Changed-file Ruff and diff checks passed. Broad precommit remains
blocked by the same eight unrelated, pre-existing `outputs/` path findings.

Storage implementation committed/pushed as `b407cb29` before marker work.
An additional temporary-copy check round-tripped all eight tables from the
actual P9 Neutral Sad workbook exactly; its source file remained unchanged.

Marker investigation: direct BDF Status-byte reads confirm zero samples of
code 3 in P56 and code 12 in P9, before MNE or Toolbox processing. Both BDFs
have consistent header/data lengths. Matching Studio logs record the first
condition start as `serial/sent` and 146 oddballs; the BDFs retain only 126
(P56) and 137 (P9) before the next condition. This supports late acquisition
or an earlier missing beginning, but a software send log cannot prove hardware
receipt. Run-start timestamps include setup and are not exact lost durations.
The application already logged these missing outputs on June 16 (P9) and
September 2 (P56), before the NumPy changes. Active Toolbox loading is
read-only and writes derivatives to separate DAT/FIF files, never source BDF.
No complete alternative BDF was found in the bounded project/Studio folders.

Recovery needs an intact original BDF or an explicit user condition exclusion;
missing samples and start markers cannot be reconstructed. Existing exclusion
tables omitted absent outputs, leaving no condition-only GUI recovery. Add
those expected cells as separate review rows, initially unchecked, without
making them FFT-grid observations or changing scientific inclusion silently.

Recovery verification: 704 processing tests passed, 1 skipped; GUI import,
Ruff and compile gate passed without Qt execution. The read-only actual-project
audit found 244 existing outputs at 144 oddball cycles and only P9 / Neutral
Angry requiring missing-condition review; current whole-participant exclusion
of P56 was respected. Technical empty recordings were not offered as condition
choices. No source or project data was edited. Visible smoke remains pending:
Settings > Harmonics > Review FFT Crop Exclusions; confirm the missing row is
unchecked, save an explicit choice, and rerun Processing before downstream QC.
