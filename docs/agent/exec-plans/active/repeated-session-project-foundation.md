# Repeated-Session Project Foundation

## Status

Active on `codex/repeated-session-projects`.

## Confirmed Recording Additions (2026-09-08)

Follow-up baseline: `5e49aed8` on `codex/postprocessing-qc-v3`. The user has
explicitly authorized adding newly discovered BDFs to an already processed
project after a GUI confirmation of folder-derived group/session assignments.
Existing assignments remain immutable; the append operation is the narrow
exception to the recording-registry lock. Missing visits remain allowed.

- [x] Stage direct-source discoveries without registry writes, preserving
  duplicate, group/session, filename-token and existing-source validation.
- [x] Show new files and canonical participant/group/session identities in the
  existing review dialog. Cancel leaves the registry unchanged; confirmation
  revalidates the proposal before saving and continuing processing.
- [x] Add an atomic append-only model operation preserving existing entries,
  lock timestamp and output files; reject stale confirmations and stale saves.
- [x] Persist downstream invalidation with registration and prevent old
  post-processing plans from releasing a cohort that omits the additions.
- [x] Complete focused tests, read-only project preview, audits and final review.

The source folders come from the active project's canonical group/recording
context; no group membership is inferred from processed output folders.
Staging and confirmation inspect filenames and metadata, never EEG samples.
The actual Birth Control preview found the two expected new visit files among
57 sources in 0.118 seconds; the real manifest remained byte-identical. The
real registry must be updated only through the user's in-app confirmation.
No preprocessing arithmetic/order, condition selection, harmonic method,
output format, old recording, raw BDF or processed workbook is rewritten by
registration. Scientific processing and freshness validation retain their
normal ownership.

Registration completion is tracked separately from the permanent append
revision: tools-only metadata refresh cannot let an older Project object erase
new membership, and later Single-file plans cannot make completed additions
appear unfinished. Compact completion receipts are saved at pre-review coverage
only after current expected-plan/outcome accounting validates those additions;
remaining additions still block downstream release. Existing scientific release
checks remain authoritative after enrollment.

Validation: `verify.py --scope processing --tier focused` passed 1,921 tests
with five skips and 59 existing warnings; the GUI scope passed 429 non-Qt
tests. The 253 registered project-I/O tests passed when run directly, including
the newly routed recording-context suite. All changed Python files passed Ruff
and compilation; verification configuration and diff checks passed. The first
processing run encountered a transient Windows access-denied error in an
unchanged interpolation-state temporary-file replacement; the focused retry and
final full processing gate both passed.

`verify.py --scope project-io --tier focused` and
`verify.py --scope repo --tier precommit` stopped at the same eight pre-existing
hard-coded-path findings under unrelated untracked `outputs/` files. Those
files were preserved; the full repo precommit suite therefore did not run.
Qt execution remains CI-only locally, and the visible smoke below is unrun.
Architecture and user docs now describe the append exception and enrollment
gate; worker ownership and numerical method contracts did not change.

Visible smoke (CI or an approved visible environment; not run locally): open a
processed project, place a valid additional visit and a new participant BDF in
configured source folders, and click Processing. Confirm the popup lists only
new files with filename, participant, group, session/visit, full-path tooltip
and the effect on analysis freshness. Cancel and verify no registry change or
processing. Confirm, verify processing continues without the former lock error,
then cancel later QC and verify old post-processing cannot release the expanded
cohort. Finish processing and confirm normal analysis release. Repeat Single
selection, wrong-group/session filenames, duplicate visits, failed save and a
manifest/file change while the popup is open. Existing registered assignments
and processed outputs must remain intact. Check the dialog at 1280x900 and its
minimum size on Windows 11 and CachyOS.

## Goal

Add first-class repeated-session EEG projects without changing the numerical
preprocessing contract or the existing single-session project behavior.

The motivating dataset has one stable between-participant group factor
(birth-control vs no birth-control) and two recordings of the same participant:
luteal at visit 1 and follicular at visit 2, approximately two weeks later.
The implementation must remain generic: sessions are project-defined metadata,
not hard-coded menstrual-cycle concepts.

## Scientific Contract

- `participant_id` is the stable person/pairing identity.
- `group_id` is a participant-level between-subject identity and cannot change
  between recordings.
- `recording_id` is the stable raw-file, processing-ledger, derivative, and QC
  identity.
- `session_id` is the within-participant repeated-measure level.
- `visit_index` and optional interval metadata are distinct from the session
  label.
- A participant may have at most one recording per declared session.
- Missing sessions are allowed, surfaced in design/QC audits, and never filled
  with zero or silently converted into a participant exclusion.
- The motivating study always acquired luteal at visit 1 and follicular at
  visit 2. Session/phase is therefore perfectly confounded with visit order,
  elapsed time, repetition, and habituation. User-facing reports must describe
  a `session/phase-at-visit` contrast and must not claim an isolated
  physiological phase effect.
- Raw preprocessing runs independently per recording and preserves the locked
  preprocessing order and calculations.
- Standard Summed-BCA consumers use one canonical harmonic list across all
  groups and sessions. Repeated-session pooling/fingerprinting is a separately
  versioned scientific policy; sessions must never receive independently
  selected lists inside one repeated-session project.
- The locked single-session Standard FPVS Screening method remains unchanged.
  Repeated-session inference is a separate analysis mode and export contract.

## Versioned Manifest Contract

Single-session v2.1 manifests remain valid and retain their exact persisted
shape. A repeated-session project adds these v2.2 fields:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "2.2.0",
  "sessions": {
    "luteal": {"label": "Luteal", "visit_index": 1},
    "follicular": {"label": "Follicular", "visit_index": 2}
  },
  "recording_sources": {
    "bc_luteal": {
      "group_id": "birth_control",
      "session_id": "luteal",
      "raw_input_folder": ".../BC Group/Luteal"
    }
  },
  "participants": {
    "P01": {"group_id": "birth_control"}
  },
  "recordings": {
    "P01__luteal": {
      "participant_id": "P01",
      "session_id": "luteal",
      "source_id": "bc_luteal",
      "raw_file": ".../P01_BC_L.bdf",
      "visit_index": 1,
      "days_from_baseline": 0
    }
  }
}
```

Rules:

- Session, source, participant, and recording IDs are stable readable slugs;
  labels are presentation only.
- Each recording source resolves to exactly one canonical group and session.
- Each raw source folder and raw file is unique.
- A recording raw file is a direct `.bdf` child of its declared source.
- Recording participant/group membership must agree with the participant and
  source definitions.
- A repeated-session project may keep the existing group raw root as a common
  parent for compatibility, but processing discovery uses the explicit
  recording sources.
- Locked grouped projects also lock session/source definitions and recording
  assignments after the first successful repeated-session output.
- Legacy projects synthesize a default in-memory recording identity only where
  a shared consumer needs it; loading must not rewrite an old manifest.

## Output And Index Contract

- Existing single-session filenames and directories remain byte-for-byte
  compatible.
- Repeated-session Excel output retains the condition-first/group-second
  directory layout and uses a collision-safe recording filename:
  `<recording_id>_<condition>_Results.xlsx`. The project setup/import default
  recording ID is `<participant>__<session>`, while the canonical manifest ID
  remains authoritative for any explicitly named recording.
- Source-ready time-domain derivatives, manifests, caches, and ledger records
  likewise include `recording_id` so one visit cannot overwrite another.
- `WorkbookRecord` carries participant, recording, session, visit, and group
  identity. Duplicate identity is `(recording_id, condition)`.
- Downstream selection filters by stable IDs, never by generated directory or
  filename inference.
- Participant-wide, recording-wide, participant-condition, and
  recording-condition exclusions remain distinguishable.

## Processing And QC Contract

- Batch discovery enumerates every declared recording-source folder.
- Repeated participant IDs are expected across different sessions; duplicate
  participant/session or duplicate raw-file ownership hard-fails.
- Group changes across sessions hard-fail before BDF loading.
- Participant review becomes recording-aware and persists participant and
  recording changes only after confirmation.
- The processing ledger, incremental planner, preflight cache, QC rows, output
  cleanup, and provenance key work by recording ID while retaining participant
  ID for paired analysis.
- Removed-electrode decisions may differ by recording. Existing participant-
  scoped settings remain backward-compatible and act as defaults unless an
  explicit recording override exists.

## Tool Contract

### SNR Plots

- Task condition and recording session are separate controls.
- Supported descriptive views include group overlays within one session,
  session overlays within one group, and a vertically stacked stable-group
  session-overlay view at the normal single-SNR figure width.
- Session comparisons report contributing participant N for every group and
  session curve.
- Labels for the motivating project include both phase and visit.

### Scalp Maps

- One task condition may render a group-by-session panel grid with common
  per-metric color limits.
- Any within-session difference map is computed within participant first and
  then averaged; subtracting independent grand averages is not allowed.
- Maps remain descriptive and are not labelled as statistical tests.

### LORETA Project Sources

- The current LORETA Stats-ready workbook and project-source producers are
  participant-keyed and cannot represent two recording IDs for one participant
  safely.
- Repeated-session post-processing reports those three legacy outputs as
  successful, non-applicable skips while preserving source-ready derivatives
  and continuing the recording-aware full-audit export. Single-session LORETA
  behavior is unchanged.

### Statistics

- Session-aware long exports include participant, recording, group, session,
  visit, condition, ROI, DV, and QC/exclusion fields.
- A native repeated-session analysis mode is separate from Standard FPVS
  Screening.
- Its design audit reports duplicate/missing visits, stable group membership,
  observed and paired Ns, coverage, and missing-data assumptions.
- Version 1 requires exactly two stable groups and exactly two ordered
  sessions. For each explicitly declared Condition x ROI outcome it computes
  the participant change (visit 2 minus visit 1), then uses a two-sided Welch
  test to compare those changes between groups. The primary Holm family spans
  every declared outcome, including declared but non-estimable outcomes.
- Secondary paired within-group changes use two-sided one-sample tests of the
  participant changes and one separate Holm family across both groups and all
  declared outcomes. There is no imputation, model fallback, or automatic
  full Group x Session x Condition x ROI screen.
- The GUI reads the recording-aware full-audit ROI-long workbook in a worker,
  displays complete-pair coverage, requires explicit outcome selection, and
  writes primary, secondary, delta, coverage, missingness, metadata, and
  canonical long-data sheets atomically.
- Because session and visit order are perfectly aligned in the motivating
  dataset, every result uses `session/phase-at-visit` language.

### Free Harmonic Clustering

- Repeated projects are recognized automatically and use the separately
  versioned `fhc_repeated_session_batch_v1` workflow; legacy one-contrast
  projects remain unchanged.
- Exactly two stable groups, two ordered sessions, and every project condition
  produce four participant-level families: session-averaged groups, paired
  Visit 2 minus Visit 1 within each group, and the between-group difference in
  participant session change.
- All primary families use complete recording pairs. Missing visits and
  batch-local recording exclusions with required reasons remain in the audit;
  recordings are never treated as independent participants.
- One harmonic domain is selected and frozen across the entire batch. Global
  run p-values receive Holm correction across conditions within each family and
  a conservative second correction across the full batch.
- The fixed-order confounding remains in the workbook, manifest, and reporting
  guidance without adding a repeated warning to the compact GUI. The legacy
  powered-null receipt does not cover this extension.

## Delivery Slices

1. Project/session/recording schema, public context, persistence, dataset index,
   and backward-compatible tests.
2. Recording-aware discovery, review, ledger, post-export naming, QC,
   provenance, and analysis-ready export.
3. Repeated-session project creation/import UI plus CI-only pytest-qt smoke
   definitions.
4. Session-aware SNR and Scalp Maps descriptive workflows.
5. Session-aware Stats export, design audit, validated inference mode, and
   reporting.
6. Birth Control folder import/validation and visible end-to-end smoke.
7. Protective gates/skips for participant-keyed tools and post-processing
   outputs that cannot yet preserve recording identity.
8. Versioned repeated-session Free Harmonic Clustering preparation, four-family
   batch inference/export, embedded GUI, documentation, and Birth Control
   acceptance analysis.

## Birth Control Data Audit

The supplied `D:/2 - Results/Birth Control (2026)` folder is an umbrella raw
data directory, not yet an FPVS project: no `project.json` exists. It contains
55 BDF files across four group/session source folders, 30 inferred participant
IDs, 25 IDs observed in both sessions, and five with one observed session. Of
the 25 two-session IDs, 24 are unambiguous complete pairs; `P17` is the one
cross-group conflict.

The import must hard-block until these source inconsistencies are reviewed:

- `P17` appears under Control/Follicular and Birth-Control/Luteal, violating a
  stable between-participant group assignment.
- `Control Group/Follicular/P22_BC_F.bdf` is located in the Control source but
  its filename encodes BC.

Existing cross-phase JSON/XLSX files are legacy analysis artifacts rather than
canonical project state. Their workbook paths point to another machine and are
not import authority.

## Verification

Run locally safe checks only; Qt execution remains CI-only unless a visible
safe environment is explicitly approved.

```

Visible/manual smoke:

1. Create a repeated-session project with two groups and two sessions.
2. Select one raw source folder for every group/session cell.
3. Review paired, missing-session, filename/source mismatch, and group-conflict
   rows without loading BDF data.
4. Confirm processing lists recordings separately and never overwrites the
   first visit.
5. Generate one group-by-session SNR view and one Scalp Maps grid.
6. Export the session-aware analysis workbook and inspect paired/missing Ns.

Locally safe verification completed with 135 project-I/O tests, 431 processing
tests (three memmap cases rerun successfully outside the restricted sandbox),
490 Stats tests, 198 Plot Generator/Publication Maps tests, 110 Free Harmonic
Clustering tests, 296 LORETA tests, and 28 post-processing worker tests. Ruff,
compileall, GUI/protected/source-localization/Stats/print/garbage-collection
audits, and `git diff --check` passed. PySide6/pytest-qt smoke remains CI-only.
The repo path audit is blocked by eight pre-existing findings under the
user-owned untracked `outputs/rcads-*` tree; no changed feature file is
implicated.
